# Rule Authoring Guidelines

- Use YAML frontmatter with a clear `description` and either `alwaysApply: true`
  or a `globs:` pattern.
- Keep rules short and scoped to one concern; add examples only when helpful.
- Update `rule-loading.mdc` when adding or renaming rules so load triggers stay accurate.
- Follow existing naming conventions (`view-model.mdc`, `post-change-checks.mdc`).
