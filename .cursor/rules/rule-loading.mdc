# Rule Loading Guide

This file helps determine which rules to load based on the context and task at hand. Each rule file contains specific guidance for different aspects of Swift development.

## Rule Loading Triggers

### 📝 general.mdc - Core Engineering Principles
**Load when:**
- Always
- Starting any new Swift project or feature
- Making architectural decisions
- Discussing code quality, performance, or best practices
- Planning implementation strategy
- Reviewing code for improvements

**Keywords:** architecture, design, performance, quality, best practices, error handling, planning, strategy

### 🧭 logging.mdc - App Logging
**Load when:**
- Adding or changing logging in app code
- Replacing `print()` statements in `Saga/Saga/`
- Working on error reporting or diagnostics

**Keywords:** logging, LoggerService, LogSurface, oslog, print, error, debug

### ✅ post-change-checks.mdc - Verification Steps
**Load when:**
- Finishing a refactor or Swift code change
- Preparing a PR or release
- Running lint/format/build/test steps

**Keywords:** lint, format, swift-format, checks, build, xcodebuild, test, CI

### 🎨 view.mdc - SwiftUI Views
**Load when:**
- Creating new SwiftUI views
- Building UI components
- Implementing view performance optimizations
- Adding accessibility features
- Working with view modifiers or animations

**Keywords:** SwiftUI, View, UI, interface, component, accessibility, animation, LazyVStack, ForEach

### 🎯 view-model.mdc - ViewModel Architecture
**Load when:**
- Creating ViewModels for SwiftUI views
- Implementing state management
- Coordinating between views and business logic
- Managing async operations in UI
- Handling user interactions

**Keywords:** ViewModel, ObservableObject, state management, coordinator, business logic, user action

### 📚 rules.mdc - Rule File Creation
**Load when:**
- Creating new rule files
- Documenting coding standards
- Establishing team conventions
- Reviewing or updating existing rules
- Meta-discussions about rule effectiveness

**Keywords:** rule file, documentation, standards, conventions, meta-rules, YAML frontmatter

## Quick Reference

```swift
// When working on a new feature:
// Load: general.mdc, view.mdc, view-model.mdc, logging.mdc

// When reviewing code:
// Load: general.mdc

// When integrating external libraries:
// Load: general.mdc, logging.mdc

// When creating documentation:
// Load: general.mdc, rules.mdc

// When finishing a refactor or adding new code:
// Load: post-change-checks.mdc
```

## Rule Combinations

### Feature Development
1. Start with `general.mdc` for architecture decisions
2. Use `view-model.mdc` for state coordination
3. Apply `view.mdc` for UI implementation
4. Add `logging.mdc` when touching logs or error reporting

### Code Review & Maintenance
1. Apply `general.mdc` for quality standards
2. Add `logging.mdc` or `post-change-checks.mdc` when relevant
3. Reference specific domain rules as needed

### Complex Problem Solving
1. Apply `general.mdc` for core principles
2. Follow domain-specific rules for implementation

## Loading Strategy

1. **Always load `general.mdc` first** - It provides the foundation
2. **Load domain-specific rules** based on the task
3. **Load supporting rules** as needed (logging or post-change checks)
4. **Keep loaded rules minimal** - Only what's directly relevant
5. **Refresh rules** when switching contexts or tasks
